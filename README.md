# c_opengl
2D OpenGL render engine. Features batch rendering and utilizes a custom shader pre-compiler which allows you to merge the shaders into one file.

## Getting Started
To get started with the example, you will need to have Make and GCC (and on Linux GLFW) installed. 

If you're on Windows, first follow the instructions in the Makefile comments. 

Run `make`. Then, run the compiled binary by `./example.out`.
